To build and run your Docker container using the provided Dockerfile, follow these steps:

Navigate to the directory containing your Dockerfile: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your Dockerfile is located.


cd path/to/your/project

Build the Docker image: Use the docker build command to create a Docker image from your Dockerfile. Replace your-image-name with a name for your Docker image.


docker build -t your-image-name .

Run the Docker container: Use the docker run command to start a new container from your image. Replace your-container-name with a name for your container.


docker run -p 8501:8501 --name your-container-name your-image-name


This command maps port 8501 on your local machine to port 8501 in the container, allowing you to access the Streamlit app in your browser at http://localhost:8501.

Verify the Streamlit app: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501 to verify that your Streamlit app is running correctly.

Here is a summary of the commands you need to run:


cd path/to/your/project
docker build -t your-image-name .
docker run -p 8501:8501 --name your-container-name your-image-name
